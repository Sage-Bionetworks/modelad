Stage 1



ADD Synapse Study folder: Study_SynID

ADD Synapse Staging folder: Staging_SynID

ADD contributor’s SynID or add their SynID to the appropriate Synapse Team

Synapse Teams [ADD_URL]

GRANT upload permission to the staging folder

REPLY to AD-EL with Upload instructions [ADD_URL]

Upload through the Synapse web interface works well for transferring a few files, but the Synapse CLI client should be used for uploading files in bulk.

CREATE Jira ticket for governance to add Access Restrictions (AR)  (for human data)

In Jira, the ticket component should be "Add, Edit, or Remove Synapse Access Restriction/Click-wrap".

VERIFY all of these restrictions implemented correctly!

Study Description

This study provides bulk RNA-seq, immunohistochemistry and biochemistry data of Bin1<em1Aduci> homozygous (Jax stock number: 035872), 5xFAD hemizygous (Jax stock number: 034848), Bin1<em1Aduci> homozygous; 5xFAD hemizygous, and C57BL6/J (Jax stock number: 000664). Neuronal BIN1 localizes to pre-synaptic termini where it functions in excitatory synaptic transmission via regulation of neurotransmitter vesicle dynamics. Mouse Bin1 gene carrying the K426R mutation that corresponds to the SNP (rs138047593) found in human BIN1 that encodes a missense mutation associated with increased risk of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. For clarification purpose, Bin1<em1Aduci> is presented as Bin1-K358R or Bin1K358R under this study.

Public Release Notes: 

Rationale for sharing these data are in Synapse and portal. Highlight the relevance and import clear and accessible language. When should we get this information?

Stage 3

VERIFY Data Uploaded

SETUP Synapse project for DCA

https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/wiki/spaces/SCHEM/pages/2458648589/Setting+up+a+DCC+Asset+Store#How-do-I-Structure-My-DCC-Synapse-Project-to-Work-with-the-Data-Curator-App%3F

Set dataset

Create fileview for DCA. 

SEND DCA instructions boiler-plate language [ADD_URL] to user in ADEL ticket 

Contributor must submit verified metadata using DCA for each of the following:

Individual

Biospecimen

Assay-specific metadata

VERIFY metadata has been applied to files in Synapse project

VERIFY metadata file version has been updated



ADD study name to SynapseAnnotations/terms/neuro/study.json

study folder added to data tracking table



Stage 4

The content in Synapse drives the individual public-facing portals. Thus, it is necessary to edit the following tables.



UPDATE the following Synapse tables as needed:

Portal - Studies Table | syn17083367 

Portal - Experimental Models | syn22219805

Studies for Validation Apps table ?

AnalysisResultsPerStudy ?

WRITE Public release Notes

Request concise summary of the datasets from contributor

VERIFY governance tickets resolved

Governance has added necessary permissions to Data and Staging folders (for human data)

ADD Study URL to Staging Portal
