### Study Configuration and Data Management

1. **Study Templates and Configuration Files**

        * Develop a YAML template for study configurations (e.g., `study_template.yaml`)
        * Define fields for study name, Synapse ID, data location, and workflow tasks
        * Generate individual study configuration files using the templates (e.g., `study_config.yaml`)
        * Specify data locations with Synapse IDs

2. **Study Workflow Tasks**

        * Identify the steps involved in each study workflow (e.g., data collection, analysis, reporting)
        * Document the workflow steps for each study in a spreadsheet or table
        * Review and refine the workflows as needed

### Documentation and Wiki

1. **Document Study Process**

        * Write a comprehensive guide to the study process, including acknowledgment statements
        * Create an outline for the documentation (e.g., introduction, methodology, results, discussion)
        * Fill in the outline with detailed information about each step of the study process

2. **Documentation Format Conversion (if needed)**

        * Determine if any documentation files need to be converted from DOCX to Markdown format
        * Create a Python script to convert DOCX files to Markdown (e.g., `docx_to_markdown.py`)
        * Test the conversion script on sample files

3. **Update URLs in Documentation**

        * Review existing documentation for outdated or incorrect URLs
        * Update URLs to point to the correct locations (e.g., content drivers, study results)

### Portal Content and Verification

1. **Synapse Tables for Portal Content**

        * Identify which Synapse tables are used as data sources for portal content
        * Document the table names and their corresponding fields in a spreadsheet or table

2. **Resolve Content Drivers**

        * Clarify the content drivers (e.g., study results, metadata) for each study
        * Document the content drivers in a spreadsheet or table

3. **Staging Portal Testing**

        * Set up a staging portal environment to test study content and workflow
        * Test the studies on the staging portal to ensure they display correctly
        * Verify that any automated workflows (e.g., data import) are functioning as expected

### Process Documentation and Automation

1. **Pseudocode Development Guide**

        * Write a step-by-step guide to the development process, using pseudocode as a starting point
        * Create an outline for the guide (e.g., introduction, setup, coding, testing)
        * Fill in the outline with detailed information about each step of the development process

2. **Script Development (as needed)**

        * Determine if any scripts are needed to automate specific tasks or workflows
        * Develop scripts using Python, R, Bash, or SQL as needed
        * Test and refine the scripts to ensure they function correctly
