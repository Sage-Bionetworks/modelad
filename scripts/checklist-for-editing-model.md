To streamline and optimize the process for editing the data model in the `data-models` repository of the AD Knowledge Portal, let's consolidate the tasks based on the steps you've outlined. The goal is to ensure each step is clearly defined and efficient, focusing on key actions that reduce redundancy and improve clarity. Hereâ€™s a refined approach:

### Revised Workflow for Editing the Data Model:

#### 1. **Setup and Access**
   - **Clone Repository**: Ensure you have the repository cloned locally. If not, clone it from GitHub.
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/adknowledgeportal/data-models.git
     ```
   - **Navigate to Modules**: Focus directly on the `modules/` directory where model editing will occur.

#### 2. **Branch Management**
   - **Create and Switch Branches**: Always work on a new branch for changes to avoid conflicts with the main branch.
     ```sh
     git checkout -b feature-branch-name
     ```

#### 3. **Edit Data Model**
   - **Modify CSV Files**: Make the necessary changes in the appropriate CSV files within the `modules/` directory.
   - **Validate Locally**: Use scripts or tools like Python or CSV lint tools to check the integrity and format of CSV files.

#### 4. **Commit and Push Changes**
   - **Commit Changes**:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Detailed description of changes"
     ```
   - **Push Changes**:
     ```sh
     git push origin feature-branch-name
     ```

#### 5. **Review and Integration**
   - **Open a Pull Request**: Use GitHub to open a pull request against the main branch and request a review from a team member.
   - **Review and Merge**: Address feedback, then merge the pull request upon approval.

#### 6. **Post-Merge Clean-up**
   - **Delete Branch** (if no longer needed):
     ```sh
     git branch -d feature-branch-name
     ```
   - **Update Documentation**: Ensure all related documentation is updated to reflect the changes made.

#### 7. **Automation**
   - **Automation Scripts**: Confirm that any associated GitHub Actions or automation scripts (e.g., `assemble_csv_data_model.py` or `schematic` conversion scripts) execute correctly after changes are pushed.

### Tips for Efficient Workflow:

- **Use Descriptive Names for Branches and Commits**: This helps in tracking changes and understanding the history of modifications without needing to dive deep into the code.
- **Regularly Pull Changes from Main**: To keep your branch up to date and reduce conflicts during merges.
- **Keep Communication Open**: Regularly update and consult with the AD DCC team on Slack for complex changes or when in doubt.

### Additional Resources:

- **GitHub Repository for Old Code**: [ryaxley/curation](https://github.com/ryaxley/curation/tree/main/MODEL-AD)
- **GitHub Repository for New Code**: [Sage-Bionetworks/modelad](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/modelad)

This revised workflow focuses on clarity and efficiency, removing redundant steps and ensuring that each stage of the process is well-documented and easy to follow. By streamlining these steps, you can focus more on the quality of edits and less on managing the process.
